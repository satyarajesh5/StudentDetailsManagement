# Student Details Management Application

### Overview

The Student Details Management System is a Spring Boot application designed to manage student records. This application implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage student information effectively. It provides a robust and scalable solution for handling student data in educational institutions or any other context requiring student management.

### Features

#### Create: Add new student records with relevant details.
#### Read: Retrieve and display student information.
#### Update: Modify existing student records.
#### Delete: Remove student records from the system.
### Technologies Used
Spring Boot: For building the RESTful web service.
Spring Data JPA: For interacting with the SQL database.
SQL Database: Used for persistent storage (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Java 17: The programming language used.
Maven: For project management and dependency resolution.

### Prerequisites
Java 17

Maven 3.6 or higher

Spring Tool Suite (STS) or any other IDE of your choice

## Configuration
### Database Configuration:

Configure your SQL database connection in the src/main/resources/application.properties file.

Example configuration for MySQL:

spring.datasource.password=password

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
